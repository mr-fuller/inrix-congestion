# inrix-congestion

This repository contains the R scripts I used to visualize road congestion in the TMACOG planning area using INRIX data. One file attempts to show a metric called Distance Weight Delay Hours (DWDH), a concept borrowed from INDOT, while another file, cmp_lottr_viz.r, visualizes a federally-mandated performance measure known as Level of Travel Time Reliability (LOTTR). The underlying calculations for the two metrics were done in postgreSQL, but the relevant SQL queries are available in a different [repository](https://github.com/mr-fuller/npmrds).
